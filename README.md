# code-quiz-assigment

This is quite a complicated assignment. Here I aiming to create a quiz with answers that shows up one at a time. Using HTML, i will build the basic struggle or "box container" to each part. From there I am not worrying about making it look too pretty by using CSS as my main focus is on JavaScript. From here I will have the following parts I need to complete:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
